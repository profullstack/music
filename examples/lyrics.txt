Verse 1:
In the digital realm where code comes alive
Every function and class helps the system thrive
Variables dancing through memory space
While algorithms solve problems with elegant grace

Chorus:
We're coding through the night
Building dreams in black and white
Every bug we debug makes us stronger
Every feature takes us longer
But we're coding through the night

Verse 2:
From the frontend to the backend flow
APIs connecting what we need to know
Databases storing all our precious data
While frameworks help us build things that matter

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Stack overflow when we're feeling lost
Open source saves us whatever the cost
Git commits tell our story true
Every merge request brings something new

(Final Chorus)
We're coding through the night
Building dreams in black and white
Every bug we debug makes us stronger
Every feature takes us longer
But we're coding through the night
Yeah, we're coding through the night!
