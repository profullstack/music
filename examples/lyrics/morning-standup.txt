Verse 1:
Coffee in hand, it's 9 AM sharp
Team gathers 'round, ready to start
Yesterday's wins, today's new goals
Everyone sharing their developer souls

Chorus:
Stand up, speak up, what did you do?
Blockers and tickets, we'll see them through
Scrum master's calling, time to align
Morning standup, everything's fine

Verse 2:
Sprint board's glowing on the big screen
User stories flowing like a machine
Velocity climbing, burndown's looking good
Agile methodology, understood

(Repeat Chorus)

Bridge:
Retrospective wisdom guides our way
Continuous improvement every day
From planning poker to definition done
We're a team, we code as one

(Final Chorus)
